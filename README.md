# E52-Senior-Design
This project aims to interface a CNC machine with a spectrum analyzer to automate magnetic field scanning process
this will be tested with a proximity sensing loop. This project is incomplete at the moment. Everything will be ran through the raspberry pi


Necessary Downloads:
Python 2.7+
numpy
matplotlib
pyQT5
RPiMotorLib


CNC interfacing:
A CNC machine was repurposed given its 3D maneuverability.  3 NEMA stepper motors, current design only incorporates one.
Using a raspberry pi, and RPI-Motor Lib to control NEMA stepper motors



Spectrum Analyzer:
Using a RSA spectrum analyzer and the example python file on the document and the below settings
